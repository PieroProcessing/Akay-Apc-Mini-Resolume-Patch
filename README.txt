This Patch is intended to work especially on Resolume but could be usefull also for other software.
The aim of the patch is to expand the number of channel of the controller in order to have a better workflow.
Open the virtual midi port of your OS.
Run the program and choose Apc as midi input and the virtual Port as output midi.
Open Resolume (or some other software) and in preferences choose the virtual midi port as input and the Apc as output. 
If the software as the option of clock input choose the virtual port as master to avoid any kind of noise signals.
Edit Midi and enjoy.

Hold the shift button and press the stop all clips button to activate the fader crtl buttons and the scene launch buttons indipendently. That means each of these buttons now is on channel 9 by default. Also the fader change channel accordingly with the fader crtl buttons. if you now hold the shift button and one of these buttons you increase the channel accordingly.
Hold the shift button and press the stop all clips button to deactivate these buttons and revert them to channel 1. Remember if you activate again the channel will be the same you left.
