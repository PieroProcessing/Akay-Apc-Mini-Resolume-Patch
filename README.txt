This Patch is intended to work especially on Resolume but could be usefull also for other software.
The aim of the patch is to expand the number of channel of the controller in order to have a better workflow.
Open the virtual midi port of your OS.
Run the program and choose Apc as midi input and the virtual Port as output midi.
Open Resolume (or some other software) and in preferences choose the virtual midi port as input and the Apc as output. 
If the software as the option of clock input choose the virtual port as master to avoid any kind of noise signals.
Edit Midi and enjoy.

Hold the shift button and press the Faders Ctrl buttons or the Scene Launch buttons to change the channel of the fader crtl buttons or the scene launch buttons accordingly to the button pressed.  Also the faders above the fader buttons change channel accordingly.
Hold the shift button and press the down arrow  button to deactivate the faders and fader buttons and revert them to channel 1 or hold the shift button and press the up arrow button to revert the scene launch buttons to channel 1. Remember if you press again the arrow buttons the channel of faders or scene buttons will be the same you left.
